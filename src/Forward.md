Programming languages are an integral part of everyday life. 
They make it easier for hobbyists, professionals, and 
companies to complete many important tasks, from fun projects 
to powerful mathematical simulations to massive data driven analytics.

The main issue with programming languages today is that sacrifices 
are always made when choosing one. Pick C or C++ and, despite their 
considerable and impressive speeds, 
they lack in ease of use and expressiveness. 
It would be considerably difficult to write 
something best written in Python in C. 
Conversely, some languages, despite significant 
versatility and ease of use, 
lack the speed and low level control necessary for use in areas where one
might use C or Rust. Consider using Python to write a memory allocator for 
example.

Other languages are embroiled in the battle between the two main 
programming paradigms and have been for more than the last decade. 
Haskell and Java come to mind. Both use fundamentally different 
models of program and algorithm design.

Wright strives to be a language for all programmers, taking 
inspiration from Java, C, Rust, and Python. Where C and Rust
have breath-taking speed, so does Wright. Where Java has a 
style of expressive variable naming and versatility, so 
does Wright. Where Haskell and Rust share a functional paradigm
that makes it easier for programmers to write robust, effective code,
so does Wright.

So no matter what you're using wright for, enjoy it.  

Contributions to the project may be made through either issue 
reporting or source code contribution.

And above all,
Thank You.
