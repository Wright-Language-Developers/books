# Getting Started
### Downloading and installing Wright
Wright's only system prerequisite is the Rust language 
(see the README on GitHub for which version is required at minimum).
After that's installed, a simple
```bash
cargo install wright
```
Will get you the latest version of wright. 

**Please note that wright is not currently stable, 
and won't be until version 1.0.0**
